# ArticleRepository
Task

Create and publish an API in SpringBoot.



1. Create a POJO called Article with attributes:

id

description

weight

volume

2. Create methods to create, delete and update a specific item.



3. The business logic must be implemented in a class called for example ArticleManagerImpl, which must implement an interface called ArticleManager.



4. Make @Autowired for dependency injection. Since there is not much code to do, using dependency injection is not easy. Try to make an extra component.



5. Don't use a database. When you create an item, for example, just create the object, don't actually insert it.



6. Implement some unit testing with JUnit



7. Run the API and do some tests from postman
